<small>Simple nim linear algebra library</small>

Future structure
-----------------

For matrix and vector, have a single file (each) implementing basic operations ( sum, multiplication, norms, etc )
Then:
- a file for linear systems ( MEG, PPMEG, hopefully LU/LUP, QR,etc in the future )
- a file for eigenvalues/eigenvectors ( Jacobi, Gauss-Siedel...)
- a file for interpolations ( lagrange polynomial, Chebychev points, Lobatto points, linear interpolation, least squares)
- a file for beziÃ©r curves, b-splines, splines ( cubic? ), De Casteljau, control polygon
- a file for numeric integration ( simpson ( and composite ) , trapezoidal... )
- a file for estimating derivatives?

Other?? Linear regressions, finite differences...?

The end user should be able to `import` the packages it needs ( just vectors, just linsystems...) .  
As an example, solving a linear system with gauss' method with partial pivoting should look like:
```nim
import snail/matrix # So we can use matrices
from snail/linsys import ppmeg as solve # It's nicer to write solve(A,b) than ppmeg(A,b)

var A = matrix2D([[1.0,0],[0.0,1]])
var b = colVector(2,[1.0,1])

proc `\`(m:Matrix,v:Vector):Vector = solve(m,v)

let x = A\b

```


On Perfomance of a naive algebra library
----------------------------------------

On an i7 4710 ( laptop ) this library requires about **3.5s** to multiply two dense matrices 200x200.
From this comes the name: Naive Algebra ( note that no particular optimization has been done yet, and it is my intention to bring the time down ).

For reference, the same operation using [linalg]() with [openblas]() takes about **0.004s**, so use that if you need something faster and are fine with
configuring external libraries etc. ( linalg also doesn't work on web, I think )

I *think* this has to do with memory access/deepCopy happening/assignments, but I will have to profile the library to find out.

Performance up to matrices 100x100 is reasonable at ~0.5s, and some testing shows a sublinear correlation between #elements and time

MatMul, Tentative Improvements
------------------------------
- parallel inner for loop -> **worse**, 4.5s vs 3.5. Probably caused by `parallel` deepCopying the `ref array` representing data

Misc notes
----------
- ~~Needs to be compiled with "--threads:on", TODO: fallback for when not threaded ( plus a warning? )~~

- Needs more tests
- Flesh out arrayutils
- Check arrayutils.zip and improve different size array handling ( eg zip(N,M) where M<N or generally M!=N ) 
- change name to SNAil? Simple Nim Algebra..i.. lib
- rework the structure to remove `include`s
- test everything
- try a more functional approach for concatenation of operations?
