TODO
====
- make nimble shut up about tests
- allow overriding epsilon value, need to move it to a common package?
- investigate default arg value for procs taking static[int]
- test everything
- try a more functional approach for concatenation of operations?
- ~~for matrix and vector, have a single file (each) implementing basic operations ( sum, multiplication, norms, etc )~~
- a file for linear systems ( GE, PPGE, hopefully LU/LUP, QR,etc in the future )
- a file for eigenvalues/eigenvectors ( Jacobi, Gauss-Siedel...)
- a file for interpolations ( lagrange polynomial, Chebychev points, Lobatto points, linear interpolation, least squares)
- a file for beziér curves, b-splines, splines ( cubic? ), De Casteljau, control polygon
- a file for numeric integration ( simpson ( and composite ) , trapezoidal... )
- a file for estimating derivatives?
